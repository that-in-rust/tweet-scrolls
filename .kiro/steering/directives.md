# Tweet-Scrolls Project Directives
## Condensed Guidelines for Development

### 🎯 Project Status
- ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY** - All core functionality implemented and tested
- ✅ **118+ Tests Passing** - Complete test coverage including new file splitter utility
- ✅ **File Size Compliance** - All files under 600-line limit
- ✅ **Enhanced Features Complete** - Reply threads, DM threads, file splitter all integrated

### 📊 Core Requirements

#### File Size Limits (CRITICAL)
- **Hard Limit**: 600 lines per file
- **Optimal Target**: 300-500 lines per file
- **Enforcement**: Regular monitoring with `find src -name "*.rs" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr`

#### Code Organization Principles
- Each module should have single responsibility
- Clear boundaries between processing, models, services
- Re-export commonly used types at module level
- Comprehensive documentation for public APIs

#### Testing Strategy
- Test files can exceed 600 lines (testing is different)
- Use helper functions to reduce test code duplication
- Separate integration tests from unit tests
- Mock private data for CI/CD pipelines

### 🔧 Technology Stack
- **Rust 2021 edition** with Tokio async runtime
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - anyhow 1.0 (Error handling)
  - chrono 0.4 (Date/time parsing)
  - serde 1.0 (JSON serialization)
  - tokio 1.0 (Async runtime)
  - csv 1.1 (CSV generation)
  - mimalloc 0.1 (Memory optimization)
  - regex 1.10 (Pattern matching)
  - indicatif 0.17 (Progress indicators)

### 🔒 Private Data Handling (CRITICAL)
- **Path**: `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/tweet-scrolls/private_data/REALDATA/`
- **Status**: ⚠️ **NEVER COMMIT TO VERSION CONTROL**
- **Usage**: Examine structure only, create anonymized samples
- **Security**: Always use relative paths, never hardcode absolute paths

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns
- **Async/await** throughout for I/O operations
- **Error propagation** using `Result<T>` and `anyhow::Context`
- **Memory optimization** with custom allocator (mimalloc)
- **Module structure** following Rust idioms

### 🧪 TDD Methodology
- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first
- **Green Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve design while keeping tests green
- **Complete Cycles**: 4 full TDD cycles completed

### 📈 Performance Considerations

 File splitting must be applied to large input files before processing to ensure memory efficiency and parallelism.
 After main processing, the CLI must automatically scan output folders and apply file-splitter to any output TXT files over 1MB, splitting them into chunks for easier review and sharing. This ensures output management and PRD compliance.
- **JavaScript Prefix**: Remove `window.YTD.*.part0 = [` prefix
- **Field Naming**: Use `#[serde(rename = "camelCaseName")]` for Twitter fields
- **Optional Fields**: Handle with `Option<T>` types
- **Streaming**: Use `serde_json::Deserializer` for large files

### 🔐 Privacy Features
- **Removed**: Blake3 Anonymization (no longer used for user ID hashing)
- **Sender Labels**: DM threads now use sender labels like 'A:' and 'B:' for clarity
- **Local Processing**: No data leaves user's machine
- **Content Masking**: Optional sensitive content protection

### 🚀 Output Generation
```
output_[user]_[timestamp]/
├── threads_[user]_[timestamp].csv          # Structured tweet data
├── threads_[user]_[timestamp].txt          # Human-readable threads
├── dm_conversations_[user]_[timestamp].csv  # DM conversation metadata
├── dm_threads_[user]_[timestamp].csv       # DM conversation threads
├── dm_threads_[user]_[timestamp].txt       # Human-readable DM threads
├── timeline_analysis_[user]_[timestamp].csv  # Activity pattern data
├── timeline_analysis_[user]_[timestamp].txt  # Activity pattern summary
├── results_[user]_[timestamp].txt           # Processing summary
└── dm_results_[user]_[timestamp].txt        # DM processing summary
```

### 🎯 Current Status - COMPLETE
✅ **All Core Features Implemented**:
- Enhanced thread reconstruction (ALL replies treated as threads)
- DM thread conversion with timing analysis
- Timeline analysis with activity pattern insights
- File splitter utility for large archive management
